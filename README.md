# Chip8
This is [Chip8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) simulator written using only Rust standard library. It displays to ANSI terminals with support for UTF-8. The purpose of this project is to serve as a break from writing my [NES emulator](https://github.com/Piturnah/nesulator) and rethink its current architecture.

Currently supports enough instuctions to run the [IBM Logo](./IBM_Logo.ch8) example.
